# Modular arithmetic in BQN
This is an extremely unstable library for doing
modular arithmetic, and general group theory for
`Z_n^\times`. 

# Functions
## Current
* Extended GCD
* LCM
* Chinese Remainder Theorem
* Inverse mod `p`
## Planned
* modpow
* Factors to n (the list of factors [[2], [3], [2,2], [5], [2,3], ...] to n)
* [Omega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_omega_function)
## Not planned
* Factoring, totient (These are available in [bqn-libs](https://github.com/mlochbaum/bqn-libs)).
